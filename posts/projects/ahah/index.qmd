This project identifies the time-weighted distance required to travel by road between every postcode in Great Britain and a selection of health-related points of interest. A ranked combination of these drive-times is used to create the AHAH index. Using the GPU-accelerated `cugraph` Python library, this implementation reduces processing time per variable down to ~10 minutes from 8 hours.
