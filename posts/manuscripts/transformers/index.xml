<abstract>
<p>Place names embedded in online natural language text present a useful
source of geographic information. Despite this, many methods for the
extraction of place names from text use pre-trained models that were not
explicitly designed for this task. Our paper builds five custom-built
Named Entity Recognition (NER) models and evaluates them against three
popular pre-built models for place name extraction. The models are
evaluated using a set of manually annotated Wikipedia articles with
reference to the F1 score metric. Our best performing model achieves an
F1 score of 0.939 compared with 0.730 for the best performing pre-built
model. Our model is then used to extract all place names from Wikipedia
articles in Great Britain, demonstrating the ability to more accurately
capture unknown place names from volunteered sources of online
geographic information.</p>

  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Place names are frequently encountered in natural language and
  provide an additional geographic dimension to much of the textual
  information present online, when associated with spatial coordinates
  and geographic locations. Despite this, research in place name
  extraction primarily concentrates on entities as described by
  annotation schemes that do not explicitly consider geographic place
  names
  (<xref alt="Karimzadeh et al. 2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">Karimzadeh
  et al. 2019</xref>;

  <xref alt="Hu, Mao, and McKenzie 2019" rid="ref-hu2019" ref-type="bibr">Hu,
  Mao, and McKenzie 2019</xref>). Pre-built named entity recognition
  (NER) models based on these schemes are also not task specific;
  trained on data unrelated to the task they are used for, despite
  language involving place names varying significantly depending on the
  context
  (<xref alt="Purves et al. 2018" rid="ref-purves2018" ref-type="bibr">Purves
  et al. 2018</xref>). When identifying place names in text, research
  typically only considers known administrative names and their
  associated strict boundaries, despite natural language often
  containing place names that either do not exist formally, are
  hyper-localised e.g. street names, or are alternative names that may
  be absent from administrative databases, which often only consider a
  single formal name.</p>
  <p>The training corpora used by pre-built NER models typically
  identifies a number of entities that have no relevance to geographic
  place names, e.g. persons, and those that have some relevance in
  specific contexts; locations, geopolitical entities or facilities
  (<xref alt="Weischedel et al. 2013" rid="ref-weischedelralph2013" ref-type="bibr">Weischedel
  et al. 2013</xref>;
  <xref alt="Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder 2003" rid="ref-tjongkimsang2003" ref-type="bibr">Tjong
  Kim Sang and De Meulder 2003</xref>). Notably, they do not
  specifically target a ‘place name’ entity, meaning, while often these
  three related entity types may often refer to a place name, this is
  not always the case. Additionally, these corpora consist of text that
  often differs in structure, compared with the text being processed by
  models trained using them; for example, social media text is typically
  more informal compared with the news articles used to build the
  popular dataset, CoNLL03
  (<xref alt="Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder 2003" rid="ref-tjongkimsang2003" ref-type="bibr">Tjong
  Kim Sang and De Meulder 2003</xref>).</p>
  <p>New forms of geographic information online present an opportunity
  to train and evaluate models on texts that contain a large volume of
  place names
  (<xref alt="Goodchild and Li 2011" rid="ref-goodchild2011" ref-type="bibr">Goodchild
  and Li 2011</xref>), building models from the ground up, and using
  annotation schemes that are explicitly designed for the extraction of
  place names from text. Results from these models are expected to
  outperform existing pre-built models which use unrelated training
  data, and do not include a ‘place name’ entity type.</p>
  <p>Our paper presents five NER models, trained on manually labelled
  Wikipedia data and used to identify and extract any span of text
  considered to be a place name, from articles relating to geographic
  locations in the United Kingdom. Our model is evaluated against
  pre-built solutions that are commonly used for this task,
  demonstrating the importance of model training with task specific
  data, and the consideration that named entity recognition as a task is
  not appropriate for place name extraction, due to the exclusion of a
  ‘place name’ entity type, and the inclusion of a number of unrelated
  entities. New developments in natural language processing (NLP) are
  utilised, outlining the benefit of selecting modern architectures that
  are not yet implemented by off the shelf models. Our paper considers
  the ability to extract place names from Wikipedia articles for the
  United Kingdom that do not appear in the GeoNames Gazetteer, with the
  goal of identifying the additional geographic information that may be
  effectively extracted from unstructured sources of online text.</p>
  <p><xref alt="Section 2" rid="sec-trans-review">Section 2</xref>
  outlines the research and concepts associated with geography in NLP,
  considering its relation to the new forms of geographic data present
  online, the techniques in natural language processing that explicitly
  deal with geography, and the developments in NLP that have enabled
  higher accuracy with limited labelled data.
  <xref alt="Section 3" rid="sec-trans-methodology">Section 3</xref>

  paper, as well as the data collection and analysis of the entities
  extracted. The performance of each NER model is then presented in
  <xref alt="Section 4" rid="sec-trans-results-discussion">Section 4</xref>
  and evaluated against pre-built solutions using a corpus of labelled
  test data. Place names are extracted using the model for the entire
  Wikipedia corpus, and compared against GeoNames, identifying names
  that are not present, discussing the reasons they may be found within
  Wikipedia articles, but not in an explicitly geographic gazetteer.</p>

<sec id="sec-trans-review">
  <title>Literature review</title>
  <p>Natural language often describes places using imprecise referents,
  non-administrative names, and an understanding of place footprints
  that does not conform with the formal administrative boundaries given
  to them
  (<xref alt="Gao, Janowicz, and Couclelis 2017" rid="ref-gao2017" ref-type="bibr">Gao,
  Janowicz, and Couclelis 2017</xref>;
  <xref alt="Goodchild and Li 2011" rid="ref-goodchild2011" ref-type="bibr">Goodchild
  and Li 2011</xref>). Despite this, regions and place names in
  computational geography are usually formally defined by administrative
  datasets, meaning any informal place names are unable to be
  identified, or associated with a position in space. This distinction
  has given rise to a focus on <italic>place</italic> based GIS, rather
  than <italic>space</italic> based, which considers the ability to
  capture place references that may not appear in administrative
  datasets
  (<xref alt="Gao et al. 2013" rid="ref-gao2013" ref-type="bibr">Gao et
  al. 2013</xref>).</p>
  <p>Since the advent of Web 2.0, increased access to mobile devices
  which include passive GPS and open-access mapping information, several
  scientific disciplines have developed to take advantage of the data
  being produced, including crowdsourcing, and user-generated content
  (<xref alt="See et al. 2016" rid="ref-see2016" ref-type="bibr">See et
  al. 2016</xref>). With geographically referenced content through
  social media, mapping platforms and Wikipedia there is now a wealth of
  information that Goodchild
  (<xref alt="2007" rid="ref-goodchild2007" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>)
  terms <italic>‘Volunteered Geographic Information’</italic> (VGI).
  These data sources present a large collection of continually updated
  references to places, often providing informal and unstructured
  geographic information.</p>
  <p>Much of the past work using VGI has concentrated either on
  explicitly geographic crowd-sourced mapping platforms like Open Street
  Map
  (<xref alt="Antoniou, Morley, and Haklay 2010" rid="ref-antoniou2010" ref-type="bibr">Antoniou,
  Morley, and Haklay 2010</xref>), or ‘geotagged’ content which enables,
  often passively contributed, user-generated data through sites like
  Twitter or Flickr, used to extract geographic information. Gao,
  Janowicz, and Couclelis
  (<xref alt="2017" rid="ref-gao2017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) for
  example present an approach for the construction of cognitive regions
  from various VGI sources, querying place names found in tags with
  associated geotags to create vague boundaries. A similar approach is
  taken by Hollenstein and Purves
  (<xref alt="2010" rid="ref-hollenstein2010" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>)
  who identified tags containing vague spatial concepts like ‘downtown’
  and ‘citycentre’, deriving regions from geotags. These methods
  demonstrate the ability to derive informal geographic information from
  VGI, while giving similar results to that of manually collected
  questionnaire data
  (<xref alt="Twaroch et al. 2019" rid="ref-twaroch2019" ref-type="bibr">Twaroch
  et al. 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Gao, Janowicz, and Couclelis 2017" rid="ref-gao2017" ref-type="bibr">Gao,
  Janowicz, and Couclelis 2017</xref>).</p>
  <p>While this work concentrates solely on the use of geotags and short
  single phrase tags associated with social media documents to analyse
  ‘place’ focussed geographies, another source of online information
  that is less frequently considered to have geographic properties is
  unstructured text, which has the potential to provide an even larger
  source of geographically focussed information. Good results have been
  reported using basic semantic rules to identify places names found in
  unstructured text
  (<xref alt="Moncla et al. 2014" rid="ref-moncla2014" ref-type="bibr">Moncla
  et al. 2014</xref>), however, these methods have relied on this text
  almost solely containing place names as entities. Alternatively to
  rule-based approaches, Hu, Mao, and McKenzie
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-hu2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  demonstrate the use of four pre-trained NER models to extract local,
  informal place names from housing advertisements descriptions with
  associated coordinates, to enrich existing gazetteers with place names
  not normally present, alongside derived boundaries. The results of
  this paper show the promising ability for NER models to extract
  informal place names directly from text, also demonstrating a
  bottom-up approach to gazetteer construction, enabling informal place
  definitions to be captured from VGI, that may be absent from
  administrative datasets. Model evaluation however showed low precision
  and recall when evaluating against a labelled dataset, reflecting
  issues with the use of pre-built NER models for this task. Similar
  evaluation results are observed by Karimzadeh et al.
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  when considering various pre-built NER models for use in the GeoTxt
  geoparsing system, which uses either SpaCy or Stanza pre-built models
  (<xref alt="Qi et al. 2018" rid="ref-qi2018" ref-type="bibr">Qi et al.
  2018</xref>;
  <xref alt="Honnibal and Montani 2017" rid="ref-honnibal2017" ref-type="bibr">Honnibal
  and Montani 2017</xref>). While the precision of these pre-built NER
  models can be relatively high for more sophisticated models, they all
  suffer from low recall. Karimzadeh et al.
  (<xref alt="2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>)
  note particularly that while improved results would be expected by
  training a model from the ground up, the amount of labelled training
  data required to create a suitable model would be very large. To
  improve the accuracy of systems that rely on place name extraction,
  NER models should be constructed with more suitable training data, and
  with annotations tailored for this specific task.</p>
  <p>While large, open-access, text-based sources of semantic geographic
  information are scarce, Wikipedia provides a large collection of
  articles about almost any subject, many of which relate to geographic
  locations. This presents an alternative data source for use in
  geographically focussed NLP applications, with place names, their
  semantic context, and article geotags providing geographic
  information. Various studies have used Wikipedia as a data source for
  the extraction of place names, DeLozier, Baldridge, and London
  (<xref alt="2015" rid="ref-delozier2015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>)
  for example, identify place names in Wikipedia articles and use a
  clustering technique using document contexts to disambiguate their
  geographic locations. Speriosu and Baldridge
  (<xref alt="2013" rid="ref-speriosu2013" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)
  use geotagged Wikipedia articles to provide contextual information
  regarding a range of place names for disambiguation. Both these works
  first use a pre-built Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify
  place names found in text, before further analysis. Improvements made
  to these NER models for place name extraction present a stronger
  foundation, leading to both better recall, and precision of place
  names being identified, before they are resolved to coordinates

  demonstrate the geographic information that may be extracted from
  unstructured text, presenting a first-stage baseline approach for
  tasks that rely on accurate place name extraction.</p>

    <title>Named entity recognition in the geographic domain</title>
    <p>Natural language processing techniques involving geography
    typically focus around geoparsing; the automated extraction of place
    names from text, followed by the resolution of the identified place
    names to geographic coordinates
    (<xref alt="Gritta, Pilehvar, and Collier 2020" rid="ref-gritta2020" ref-type="bibr">Gritta,

    <xref alt="Buscaldi 2011" rid="ref-buscaldi2011" ref-type="bibr">Buscaldi
    2011</xref>). Modern place name extraction techniques primarily rely
    on named entity recognition (NER) to identify place names as
    entities within text
    (<xref alt="Kumar and Singh 2019" rid="ref-kumar2019" ref-type="bibr">Kumar
    and Singh 2019</xref>;
    <xref alt="Purves et al. 2018" rid="ref-purves2018" ref-type="bibr">Purves
    et al. 2018</xref>). While most pre-built NER systems are able to
    identify ‘geopolitical entities’ and ‘locations’ as defined by
    popular annotation schemes<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref>,
    these only act as a proxy for place names in text. The majority of
    entities recognised by these systems are unrelated to place names,
    and as such simply contribute to lower overall recall when other
    entities are preferred by models over geographic place names. For
    example, a model may consider a named organisational headquarters as
    an ‘organisation’ entity, rather than a ‘location’, even when used
    as a locational reference.</p>
    <p>The concept of a place name as an entity defined by the labelled
    corpora NER models were trained on hinders place name extraction,
    identifying only (and any) administrative place names in text
    (<xref alt="Gritta et al. 2017" rid="ref-gritta2017a" ref-type="bibr">Gritta
    et al. 2017</xref>). The geoparser
    <italic>Mordecai</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">2</xref> for
    example, uses an NER tagger provided through the
    <monospace>SpaCy</monospace> Python library, which provides a
    variety of entities including those unrelated to place names (e.g. :
    persons), and three entities that may be considered related,
    (Geopolitical Entity), (Location), and (Facility). While these
    categories often do relate to place names, they do not consider
    whether the entity could be contextually considered a place name
    that could be geo-located. For example, geopolitical entities are
    often used in a metonymic sense; a figure of speech where a concept
    is substituted by a related concept. In the phrase ‘Madrid plays
    Kiev today’ for example, sports teams are replaced by their
    associated place name
    (<xref alt="Gritta, Pilehvar, and Collier 2020" rid="ref-gritta2020" ref-type="bibr">Gritta,
    Pilehvar, and Collier 2020</xref>). As place name based metonyms do
    not explicitly relate to geographic locations, and instead a related
    entity, we are uninterested in their extraction. Due to the reliance
    on large labelled corpora for NER training, and limited source of
    geography specific data
    (<xref alt="Karimzadeh et al. 2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">Karimzadeh
    et al. 2019</xref>), little work has considered explicitly targeting
    place names through new data, as it is often time-consuming to
    produce.</p>
    <p>While at present pre-built NER models identify entities as
    defined by widely used annotated corpora, some work has considered
    the need to identify <italic>spatial</italic> entities. SpatialML is
    a natural language annotation scheme that presents the
    <bold>PLACE</bold> tag for any mention of a location
    (<xref alt="Mani et al. 2010" rid="ref-mani2010" ref-type="bibr">Mani
    et al. 2010</xref>). Tasks identified by the
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://semeval.github.io/">Semantic
    Evaluation Workshop</ext-link> built on this annotation scheme and
    defined several entities relating to spatial language (SemEval-2015
    Task 8: SpaceEval,
    <xref alt="Pustejovsky et al. 2015" rid="ref-pustejovsky2015" ref-type="bibr">Pustejovsky
    et al. 2015</xref>), described by the ISO-Space annotation
    specification
    (<xref alt="Pustejovsky 2017" rid="ref-pustejovsky2017" ref-type="bibr">Pustejovsky
    2017</xref>). In order to more appropriately consider geography when
    parsing unstructured text for place related entities, models should
    be built from the ground up, taking into account an alternative
    annotation scheme that identifies place names, excluding unrelated
    entities.</p>
    <p>Recent progress in NLP and the use of GPU accelerated training
    has brought with it the ability to process large quantities of
    unlabelled text. This development has recently led to the creation
    of general purpose ‘language models’ that implement the
    ‘transformer’ architecture, using semi-supervised learning to train
    using very large corpora
    (<xref alt="Vaswani et al. 2017" rid="ref-vaswani2017" ref-type="bibr">Vaswani
    et al. 2017</xref>). For example, Google’s pioneering BERT model was
    trained using the entirety of English Wikipedia, and over 11,000
    books
    (<xref alt="Devlin et al. 2019" rid="ref-devlin2019" ref-type="bibr">Devlin
    et al. 2019</xref>). This development has led to models which
    perform well for many given tasks, even with relatively limited
    additional labelled training data.</p>
    <p>Our paper proposes fine-tuning transformer-based language models
    for place name extraction using named entity recognition, to extract
    all place names from UK ‘place’ classed articles on Wikipedia. 200
    of these articles are annotated, labelling place names to train and
    evaluate model performance. We train and compare the performance of
    three popular transformer-based NER models; BERT - a large, popular
    transformer model, RoBERTa - similar to BERT, using a different
    pre-training procedure, which has had better results on some tasks,
    and DistilBERT - a much smaller and less complex transformer model
    based on RoBERTa. In addition to these transformer models, two
    simpler Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models are compared, one using
    pre-trained GloVe embeddings, representing an equivalent complexity
    model used by Stanza or SpaCy pre-built NER solutions, and another
    showing a baseline model without any pre-trained word embeddings.
    These models are then evaluated against three pre-built NER systems
    that are popular for place name extraction, and used in existing
    geoparsing systems including GeoTxt and Mordecai.</p>

      ontologies that link and define information in articles. A query
      was built to obtain English Wikipedia abstracts for each DBpedia
      article with the <monospace>Place</monospace> class in Great
      Britain, using the
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbpedia.org/sparql">DBpedia
      SPARQL endpoint</ext-link>. Querying just for
      <monospace>Place</monospace> articles within Great Britain ensured
      that articles extracted contained a large number of place names
      and language indicative of place names, without additional,
      unnecessary information.</p>
      <p>These abstracts are the text provided at the top of each
      article, before any headings, sometimes called the summary. As an
      example, the Wikipedia abstract for
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatts_Hill">Rowlatts
      Hill</ext-link>, a suburb of Leicester, UK is as follows, with

        <p>Rowlatts Hill (also known as Rowlatts Hill Estate, or R.H.E.)

        <p>The suburb is roughly bordered by Spencefield Lane to the

        Green Lane Road; Rowlatts Hill borders <bold>Crown Hills</bold>
        to the west. To the north, at the bottom of Rowlatts Hill is
        Humberstone Park which is located within Green Lane Road,
        Ambassador Road and also leads on to Uppingham Road (the

      <p>For use in the models, a random subset of 200 articles were
      annotated using the CoNLL-03 NER format, which uses line
      delimitation to separate tokens, with entities associated with
      each token sharing the same line, separated by a space. Articles
      were first cleaned using regular expressions to remove quotation
      marks, text inside parentheses, and non-ascii characters. The
      <monospace>SpaCy</monospace> large web-based pre-trained model
      pipeline (<monospace>en_core_web_lg</monospace>) was used for
      further processing, using a non-monotonic arc-eager
      transition-system for sentence segmentation
      (<xref alt="Honnibal and Johnson 2015" rid="ref-honnibal2015" ref-type="bibr">Honnibal
      and Johnson 2015</xref>), and tokenisation using a rule-based
      algorithm. Each sentence-length sequence of tokens was treated as
      a separate instance to be fed as batches into models for training.
      Each token in every sequence was annotated as being a place name
      or not, assisted through the open source annotation tool
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/doccano/doccano">Doccano</ext-link>
      (<xref alt="Nakayama et al. 2018" rid="ref-nakayama2018" ref-type="bibr">Nakayama
      et al. 2018</xref>).</p>
      <p>For place names that span multiple tokens, the
      <italic>BIOUL</italic> tagging scheme was used, which stands for
      the ‘<italic><bold>B</bold>eginning</italic>,
      <italic><bold>I</bold>nside</italic> and
      <italic><bold>L</bold>ast</italic> tokens of multi-token chunks’;
      for place names that span more than one token
      (e.g. <italic>B-Place</italic>: New, <italic>L-Place</italic>:
      York). ‘<italic><bold>U</bold>nit-length</italic> chunks and
      <italic><bold>O</bold>utside</italic>’, place names of only a
      single token, and outside for any token that isn’t a place name.
      This scheme was used over the simpler BIO scheme which is more
      difficult for models to learn
      (<xref alt="Ratinov and Roth 2009" rid="ref-ratinov2009" ref-type="bibr">Ratinov
      and Roth 2009</xref>). During annotation it became clear that the
      length of certain multi-token place names could be considered
      ambiguous. For example, it may not be clear when a cardinal
      direction is part of a place name, ‘northern Ireland’ may refer to
      a northern region in Ireland, while ‘Northern Ireland’ refers to
      the constituent country in the United Kingdom. To unify labelling
      decisions we chose to consider capitalisation as an indication of
      multi-token noun phrases that constituted a single place name. The
      following sentence shows a sequence of tokens with their
      corresponding tags, demonstrating the annotation scheme with
      <italic>BIOUL</italic> information prepending each tag:</p>
      <p>From these 200 labelled Wikipedia abstracts, 10% were kept for
      both validation and testing, leading to a training set of 21,080
      labelled tokens, a validation dataset of 2,907 labelled tokens,
      and a testing dataset of 3,347 labelled tokens.</p>

    two-layer Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with 200 hidden dimensions.
    The output from the BiLSTM was input into a conditional random field

    architecture described in Peters et al.
    (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-peters2018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>),
    adding pre-trained GloVe token embeddings
    (<xref alt="Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014" rid="ref-pennington2014" ref-type="bibr">Pennington,
    Socher, and Manning 2014</xref>) with 50 dimensions and 16 dimension
    character embeddings. Both models used the
    <monospace>Adam</monospace> optimiser which makes use of stochastic
    gradient descent for weight optimisation
    (<xref alt="Kingma and Ba 2017" rid="ref-kingma2017" ref-type="bibr">Kingma
    and Ba 2017</xref>).</p>
    <p>Three BERT-based transformer models were also created, using BERT
    (<xref alt="Devlin et al. 2019" rid="ref-devlin2019" ref-type="bibr">Devlin
    et al. 2019</xref>), RoBERTa which attempts to optimise the training
    process of BERT
    (<xref alt="Liu et al. 2019" rid="ref-liu2019" ref-type="bibr">Liu
    et al. 2019</xref>), and DistilBERT, which distils the data used in
    pre-training to create a smaller, faster model
    (<xref alt="Sanh et al. 2020" rid="ref-sanh2020" ref-type="bibr">Sanh
    et al. 2020</xref>). The primary architecture of transformers is
    ‘attention’ which enables them to consider and weight each word in a
    sequence against each other word simultaneously. This allows them to
    be highly parallel, providing significant improvements to
    computational speed with GPUs which can handle highly parallel
    tasks, and benefits over traditional architectures like Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) which are only able to consider sequences
    sequentially
    (<xref alt="Vaswani et al. 2017" rid="ref-vaswani2017" ref-type="bibr">Vaswani
    et al. 2017</xref>). These models were pre-trained on very large
    general text corpora, enabling ‘transfer learning’, where a
    pre-trained model like BERT is used as a base and fine-tuned to be
    task specific. Conceptually, these pre-trained models learn deep
    embedded weights for words based on comprehensive contextual
    information extracted from the large general text corpora, these
    then only require smaller adjustments in fine-tuning to achieve good
    task-specific results. Fine-tuning these pre-trained models in NLP
    has produced results that often outperform models using traditional
    architectures that include manually trained word embeddings
    (Word2Vec,

    <p>Pre-trained transformer models replace both the BiLSTM layers of
    the previous models and token embeddings, taking encoded sequences,
    associating each token with a 768 dimension vector representation
    from a vocabulary, feeding them into sequential transformer layers
    and outputting into a CRF classifier. Each model was initialised
    with pre-trained weights provided by the
    <monospace>transformers</monospace> Python library
    (<xref alt="Wolf et al. 2020" rid="ref-wolf2020" ref-type="bibr">Wolf
    et al. 2020</xref>), these weights are initialised in both the
    embedding layers and intermediate layers. For weight optimisation,
    these models used the weight decay Adam algorithm
    (<monospace>AdamW</monospace>,
    <xref alt="Loshchilov and Hutter 2019" rid="ref-loshchilov2019" ref-type="bibr">Loshchilov

    updated during training, which enabled the pre-trained weights to

    numbers in some operations which reduced the memory overhead and
    increased computation speed. For transformers, the learning rate was
    optimised towards the end of training, using a

    reducing the learning rate by 1/10th once the overall F<sub>1</sub>

    number of <monospace>PLACE</monospace> entities, accuracy should be
    considered a poor metric, and is only included for completeness.
    This class imbalance means that as only approximately 15% of tokens
    are labelled as entities, it is possible to achieve 85% accuracy and
    high precision by labelling all tokens as not entities.
    F<sub>1</sub> score is often used to compensate for these issues in

    itself a perfect metric. With respect to the best performing

    demonstrates the ability for our DistilBERT transformer model to
    accurately ignore entities that do not relate to place names. This
    example paragraph only refers to a single geographic location in
    text, the location of the 1952 Summer Games, in Helsinki, Finland.
    While Stanza identifies a large number of GPE tags, they either
    relate to China used in a metynomic sense, meaning the Chinese
    Olympic team (‘China competed’), or as a related geopolitical noun
    (‘delegation of ROC’), which is not considered to be a place name
    referring to a geographic location in this context. Our model
    correctly infers the single mention of a geographic place name based
    on the contextual information, meaning a large amount of unrelated
    information is excluded. Particularly, recognising and ignoring
    these nouns related to place names is something that is noted as an
    issue in current geoparsing systems
    (<xref alt="Gritta, Pilehvar, and Collier 2020" rid="ref-gritta2020" ref-type="bibr">Gritta,
    Pilehvar, and Collier 2020</xref>). This figure also demonstrates
    the importance of using a pre-trained model base for this task, as
    the BiLSTM CRF performs poorly. It is likely that this issue stems
    from the limited training data used, as the model is unable to learn
    more complex cases where place names are less obvious
    (<xref alt="Figure 3" rid="fig-qual-china">Figure 3</xref> (B)).
    Using a pre-trained transformer enables the model to correctly
    identify instances where proper nouns do not relate to place names,
    taking information learned through its pre-training procedure.</p>

    ‘Tyne’ (e.g. ‘Tyne and Wear’ or ‘River Tyne’). The DistilBERT model
    also extracts around 6 times the number of place names compared with
    SpaCy, reflected by the low recall noted above. One example where
    the DistilBERT model appears confused is by giving the place name
    ‘Church of England’, this problem relates to the language used in

    mentioned in single instances (e.g. road names: Shady Lane,
    Chapeltown Road), organisational names used in a place related
    context (e.g. describing locations along the Great Western Railway
    route), and alternative names that are not captured by GeoNames. For
    example, ‘M1’ appears in GeoNames as ‘M1

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>Our paper demonstrates a new approach towards the extraction of
  place names from text by building an NER model using data annotated
  with geographic place names. This work aims to direct geographic NLP
  research towards the use of models which move away from the
  generalisable annotation schemes of pre-built NER solutions, to
  include task-specific, relevant training data. Notably this differs
  from the perceived generalisability of pre-built models used for
  general geoparsing. We believe this is an important approach for
  geographic place name extraction given geographic language differs
  greatly based on context
  (<xref alt="Purves et al. 2018" rid="ref-purves2018" ref-type="bibr">Purves
  et al. 2018</xref>), with contexts varying greatly based on the
  corpora used for inference. This is demonstrated by the poor results
  observed in previous work when applying pre-built NER solutions, which
  use training data unrelated to the task-specific data they are being
  applied to
  (<xref alt="Hu, Mao, and McKenzie 2019" rid="ref-hu2019" ref-type="bibr">Hu,
  Mao, and McKenzie 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Karimzadeh et al. 2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">Karimzadeh
  et al. 2019</xref>). Wallgrün et al.
  (<xref alt="2018" rid="ref-wallgrun2018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>)
  recognise this problem, developing GeoCorpora, a task-specific
  training dataset for micro-blog geoparsing, notably describing
  increased issues with annotation ambiguity compared with more
  traditional text-sources. Additionally, recent work with transformer
  models, typically only built to be generalisable, have considered
  moving from fully generalised self-supervised training towards more
  dataset-specific models (e.g. TweetEval; Barbieri et al.
  (<xref alt="2020" rid="ref-barbieri2020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>)),
  with results that outperform generalisable transformer models
  (<xref alt="Nguyen, Vu, and Nguyen 2020" rid="ref-nguyen2020" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen,
  Vu, and Nguyen 2020</xref>).</p>
  <p>Ultimately, the decision to produce a model explicitly designed to
  be non-generalisable to other corpora may be considered a limitation
  of the scope of this paper. We have demonstrated a best-case scenario
  where time-frames allow for manual annotation of task-specific data.
  Future research may consider the construction of a more generalisable
  place name extraction model, which takes inspiration from the
  alternative annotation scheme employed by our paper, allowing for use
  in general purpose geoparsers.</p>
  <p>Additionally, while our paper selects Wikipedia for place name
  extraction, due to its large volume, ease of validation and data
  retrieval, future work may consider the ability to apply our
  methodology to other text sources. With suitable models constructed,
  using annotated training data that is relevant to the corpus being
  considered, we expect future work applied to other data sources may
  present the opportunity to further contribute to place names that are
  absent from gazetteers, as vernacular place names. We believe that
  given a suitable combination of data sources, our methodology is the
  first step towards the construction gazetteers from the bottom-up,
  directly taking place names from passive contributions, without
  relying on pre-built datasets.</p>
  <p>The recent development of pre-trained language models and their
  suitability for fine-tuning in many tasks, including NER, presents a
  method for the construction of accurate models that are task specific,
  using relatively small labelled
  corpora<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">4</xref> that defines entities
  more suited to the task of place name extraction. The architecture in
  our paper is more simplistic to implement than other attempts at
  similar tasks (e.g.
  <xref alt="Weissenbacher et al. 2019" rid="ref-weissenbacher2019" ref-type="bibr">Weissenbacher
  et al. 2019</xref>), with most of the complexity hidden within the
  transformer layers. This, combined with libraries that abstract and
  implement state of the art models, provides a more accessible approach
  for research in place name extraction, without requiring a deep
  understanding of semantic rules, or the construction of deep
  multi-layered models from the ground up.</p>
  <p>Evaluation against pre-built NER models on
  <xref alt="Table 3" rid="tbl-eval">Table 3</xref> shows that
  performance for place name extraction is greatly improved,
  particularly with respect to recall, a notable issue with past studies
  (<xref alt="Hu, Mao, and McKenzie 2019" rid="ref-hu2019" ref-type="bibr">Hu,
  Mao, and McKenzie 2019</xref>;
  <xref alt="Karimzadeh et al. 2019" rid="ref-karimzadeh2019" ref-type="bibr">Karimzadeh
  et al. 2019</xref>). The construction of an NER model for the task
  specific extraction of place names moves towards systems that
  appropriately consider the geographic elements present in natural
  language. The large number of place names that are absent from the
  GeoNames gazetteer suggests that geoparsing and related work likely
  misses a substantial amount of geographic information present in text.
  The dataset produced through this work aims to assist with filling
  these gaps, while the methodology described enables an approach that
  may be mirrored and applied to further work on other data sources.</p>
  <p>Finally, both ‘place’ focussed annotation schemes describe the use
  of ‘nominal’ place related entities
  (<xref alt="Mani et al. 2010" rid="ref-mani2010" ref-type="bibr">Mani
  et al. 2010</xref>;
  <xref alt="Pustejovsky 2017" rid="ref-pustejovsky2017" ref-type="bibr">Pustejovsky
  2017</xref>). While out of the scope of our work, we would like to
  encourage the focus on extracting this additional geographic
  information from text. Often in language the use of these non-specific
  terms are used, for example ‘I visited the shops’, ‘York is a city’,
  provide geographically specific information. ‘The shops’ with enough
  context may provide a specific geographic location, and similarly the
  link between ‘York’ -&gt; ‘city’ could be explored
