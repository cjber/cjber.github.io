<abstract>
<p>This paper explores cognitive place associations; conceptualised as a
place-based mental model that derives subconscious links between
geographic locations. Utilising a large corpus of online discussion data
from the social media website Reddit, we experiment on the extraction of
such geographic knowledge from unstructured text. First we construct a
system to identify place names found in Reddit comments, disambiguating
each to a set of coordinates where possible. Following this, we build a
collective picture of cognitive place associations in the United
Kingdom, linking locations that co-occur in user comments and evaluating
the effect of distance on the strength of these associations. Exploring
these geographies nationally, associations were shown to be typically
weaker over greater distances. This distance decay is also highly
regional, rural areas typically have greater levels of distance decay,
particularly in Wales and Scotland. When comparing major cities across
the UK, we observe distinct distance decay patterns, influenced
primarily by proximity to other cities.</p>

  through population movement conceals associations that persist through
  individuals or community subconscious, regardless of any physical
  movement.</p>
  <p>Literature discussing the role of human cognition in constructing
  mental images of cities
  (<xref alt="Lynch 1964" rid="ref-lynch1964" ref-type="bibr">Lynch
  1964</xref>), and how they can be represented through mental maps
  (<xref alt="Gould and White 1986" rid="ref-gould1986" ref-type="bibr">Gould
  and White 1986</xref>), reveals that the way humans conceive spatial
  structures and associations between places are substantially
  entrenched in individuals’ experiences and geographic knowledge, which
  only partially derive from movements. Places represent a complex
  network of socio-spatial relationships that emerge from linked
  individual experiences
  (<xref alt="Pierce, Martin, and Murphy 2011" rid="ref-pierce2011" ref-type="bibr">Pierce,
  Martin, and Murphy 2011</xref>), enabling the definition of
  collectively recognised place associations. While movements in

  2018</xref>;
  <xref alt="Patterson and Farber 2015" rid="ref-patterson2015" ref-type="bibr">Patterson
  and Farber 2015</xref>), representational spaces expressed through
  mental maps are not necessarily bounded by spatio-temporal constraints
  (<xref alt="Merrifield 1993" rid="ref-merrifield1993" ref-type="bibr">Merrifield
  1993</xref>). Modern developments in transport and communication
  access warp the perceptions of distance between places
  (<xref alt="Massey 2008" rid="ref-massey2008" ref-type="bibr">Massey

  (<xref alt="Fabrikant et al. 2002" rid="ref-fabrikant2002" ref-type="bibr">Fabrikant
  et al. 2002</xref>).</p>
  <p>Alternatively, online sources of data offer novel opportunities to
  explore place associations, built directly from the passive
  contributions of individual users. Recent work has demonstrated how
  digital social friendships
  (<xref alt="Bailey et al. 2018" rid="ref-bailey2018" ref-type="bibr">Bailey
  et al. 2018</xref>), or embedded links in Wikipedia articles
  (<xref alt="Salvini and Fabrikant 2016" rid="ref-salvini2016" ref-type="bibr">Salvini
  and Fabrikant 2016</xref>), may be used to provide insight into social
  place connections. Other works have instead considered that text
  itself can be used to quantify relationships between geographic terms,
  described as ‘geo-semantic relatedness’
  (<xref alt="Ballatore, Bertolotto, and Wilson 2014" rid="ref-ballatore2014" ref-type="bibr">Ballatore,
  Bertolotto, and Wilson 2014</xref>). Work building on this concept has
  applied it to city and region names identified in news articles,
  social media, and general web pages

  <p>Distance is a key influence on observed levels of connectivity in
  spatial interaction literature
  (<xref alt="Haynes and Fotheringham 1985" rid="ref-haynes1985" ref-type="bibr">Haynes
  and Fotheringham 1985</xref>), and Tobler’s first law of geography,
  where locations that are further apart are typically less
  well-connected
  (<xref alt="Tobler 1970" rid="ref-tobler1970" ref-type="bibr">Tobler

  (<xref alt="Taylor 1983" rid="ref-taylor1983" ref-type="bibr">Taylor
  1983</xref>), which has various forms of mathematical representation.
  Given a legacy of empirical evidence, distance decay in its various
  forms can be sensibly assumed in place connections when both temporal
  and spatial constraints are considered in our physical environment.
  However, when considering the links between locations from the
  perspective of cognitive associations built through mental maps, such
  constraints are no longer as restrictive
  (<xref alt="Fabrikant et al. 2002" rid="ref-fabrikant2002" ref-type="bibr">Fabrikant
  et al. 2002</xref>). Quantifying the effect of distance on cognitive
  place associations may therefore result in unexpected patterns in the
  effect of distance on associations, that reveal the cognitive biases
  used to construct mental maps.</p>
  <p>The objective of this paper is to quantify cognitive place
  associations across the UK<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> to
  build mental maps, while evaluating the effect of distance on the
  strength of these associations, measuring the level of distance decay
  through a gravity model. To generate association measures from a
  cognitive rather than geographic perspective, we infer associations
  through co-occurring locations extracted from a large corpus of
  informal, unstructured and discursive text from the social media
  website Reddit. Locations when mentioned in informal comments are
  drawn from a cognitive process associated with mental maps of these
  locations, subconsciously illustrating associations between places
  from memory and based on experience.</p>

  <p>The term ‘mental map’ typically refers to the cognitive
  visualisation of a geographic environment. They represent collective,

  relationships between them
  (<xref alt="Kaplan 1976" rid="ref-kaplan1976" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan

  entirely
  (<xref alt="Gould and White 1986" rid="ref-gould1986" ref-type="bibr">Gould

  contributing generalised information regarding areas that are deemed

  locations.</p>
  <sec id="quantifying-associations">

    <p>Within mobility research, connections between locations are

    (<xref alt="Shaw and Hesse 2010" rid="ref-shaw2010" ref-type="bibr">Shaw

    <xref alt="Haynes and Fotheringham 1985" rid="ref-haynes1985" ref-type="bibr">Haynes

    leads to a decrease in spatial interaction, known as ‘distance
    decay’
    (<xref alt="Taylor and Openshaw 1975" rid="ref-taylor1975" ref-type="bibr">Taylor
    and Openshaw 1975</xref>). While conceptualising geographic
    connections in this manner builds a picture that is constrained by
    spatio-temporal movement, this is not necessarily a requirement for
    a more generalised understanding of associations as a geographic
    concept
    (<xref alt="Merriman 2012" rid="ref-merriman2012" ref-type="bibr">Merriman
    2012</xref>).</p>
    <p>Unlike physical connections, which are described by movements
    across Euclidean space, cognitive associations are decoupled from
    the restriction of physical movements; both the distance between
    locations, and the time taken to travel between them, do not
    directly influence the strength of cognitive associations. Instead,
    they capture the persistent perceived associations that reflect the
    experiential geographic knowledge used by individuals to generate
    ‘mental maps’
    (<xref alt="Gould and White 1986" rid="ref-gould1986" ref-type="bibr">Gould
    and White 1986</xref>). Such associations capture non-specific
    subconscious links between locations, influenced by personal

    (<xref alt="Massey 2008" rid="ref-massey2008" ref-type="bibr">Massey

    (<xref alt="Pierce, Martin, and Murphy 2011" rid="ref-pierce2011" ref-type="bibr">Pierce,
    Martin, and Murphy 2011</xref>).</p>
    <p>Traditional approaches to the exploration of differences between
    cognitive and real-world associations would have relied on the use
    of large-scale studies and active individual participation to derive
    these associations, for example through volunteered geographic
    information (VGI)
    (<xref alt="Goodchild 2007" rid="ref-goodchild2007" ref-type="bibr">Goodchild

    through hand-drawn sketches, such methods do not scale well to
    derive a population level understanding.</p>
    <p>By contrast, alternative forms of data online present an
    opportunity to infer associations between places, by capturing
    persistent links that are not temporally or spatially bounded.
    Facebook for example has been used to generate social connections
    between locations, geographically grounded based on the home
    location of two friends
    (<xref alt="Bailey et al. 2018" rid="ref-bailey2018" ref-type="bibr">Bailey

    (<xref alt="Salvini and Fabrikant 2016" rid="ref-salvini2016" ref-type="bibr">Salvini
    and Fabrikant 2016</xref>), which demonstrate connections between
    cities based on hyperlinks embedded in articles that contain general
    knowledge. Unlike these structured data sources, unstructured online
    text also provides embedded geographic information as place names,
    which may be extracted through computational techniques, such as
    natural language processing

    <p>Relationships between locational mentions in text are typically

    <p>Alternative sources include online social media, which contribute
    a large volume of natural language text submitted by many unique

    data. We argue that this approach more appropriately captures the
    cognitive information each user uses to associate two locations,
    which can then be generalised by combining associations across each
    user in the corpus.</p>

    for example identified that 2.8% of their target place names could
    refer to multiple locations, while 1% of names were words that
    appeared in the English vocabulary. In total, they identify that
    around 15% of their place names displayed some level of ambiguity,
    and quantitative assessment of the effect of this demonstrated that
    it negatively impacted the quality of the associations identified.
    To avoid such issues, instead of a simple rule-based approach for
    the extraction of place names from our text, we construct a
    structured process using machine learning. This implements
    geoparsing, which is the process of extracting place names from
    unstructured text and matching them to the correct associated
    geographic coordinates
    (<xref alt="Purves et al. 2018" rid="ref-purves2018" ref-type="bibr">Purves
    et al. 2018</xref>). This task can be divided into two stages;
    identifying place names in text, followed by the association of
    these place names with a unique identifier in a knowledge base
    (typically a gazetteer) in a process called geocoding or toponym
    disambiguation.</p>
    <p>Modern geoparsing processes use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to

    (<xref alt="Leidner and Lieberman 2011" rid="ref-leidner2011" ref-type="bibr">Leidner
    and Lieberman 2011</xref>), NER uses more complex supervised machine
    learning to identify place names. The use of machine learning allows
    for the identification of place names that do not already appear
    within formal gazetteers, which is particularly useful in research
    considering colloquial names
    (<xref alt="Hollenstein 2008" rid="ref-hollenstein2008" ref-type="bibr">Hollenstein
    2008</xref>). Word context may also be used to improve accuracy, as
    words may appear in a gazetteer but not be used in a geographic
    context (Reading could be considered a place in the UK or a noun)
    (<xref alt="Purves et al. 2018" rid="ref-purves2018" ref-type="bibr">Purves
    et al. 2018</xref>). This is particularly important when considering
    informal text, where capitalisation may not always indicate the use
    of proper nouns, misspellings may be frequent, and names that do not
    often appear in gazetteers are common.</p>
    <p>Recent work however has noted that current geoparsing systems

  <title>Methodology</title>
  <p>We first developed a task-specific geoparsing process to identify
  all place names contained within the Reddit comment corpus, resolving
  them to geographic coordinates within the United Kingdom. Cognitive
  associations were then generated between each identified location
  using co-occurrence: when identified locations are mentioned by the
  same author, they create an association between places. These
  associations are therefore built from the mental maps of individual
  Reddit users, unbounded from the typical space-time constraints of
  traditional spatial relationships derived from movements. We then
  investigate the strength of these associations by deriving aggregate
  geographic representations derived from each user, and determine the
  role of distance in shaping the strength of these associations through
  a gravity model. Finally, we select four urban and four rural regions
  to map the strength of associations geographically, demonstrating
  variations in distance decay patterns.</p>

    threads enabling users to add and respond to
    <italic>comments</italic>. Subreddits cover a wide range of topics,
    and in the interest of geography, they also act as forums for the
    discussion of local places. The United Kingdom
    subreddit<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">5</xref> acts as a general
    hub for related topics, notably including a list of smaller and more
    geographically specific related subreddits. This list provides a
    ‘Places’ section, a collection of local British subreddits, ranging
    in scale from country level (<monospace>/r/England</monospace>),
    regional (<monospace>/r/thenorth</monospace>,
    <monospace>/r/Teeside</monospace>), to cities
    (<monospace>/r/Manchester</monospace>) and small towns
    (<monospace>/r/Alnwick</monospace>). In total there are 213
    subreddits that relate to ‘places’ within the United
    Kingdom<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">6</xref>. For each subreddit,
    every single historic comment was retrieved using the
    Pushshift<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7">7</xref> Reddit archive
    (<xref alt="Baumgartner et al. 2020" rid="ref-baumgartner2020" ref-type="bibr">Baumgartner

    submitted by 490,534 unique users, between 2011-01-01 and
    2022-04-17, this represents a very large corpus of text comprising
    262 million words.</p>
    <p>We then implemented our own geoparsing methodology to extract and
    geolocate any place name mention within each comment text. We first
    identified all place name mentions using a custom-built NER
    model<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8">8</xref>. This model was built
    using a large language model called BERT
    (<xref alt="Devlin et al. 2019" rid="ref-devlin2019" ref-type="bibr">Devlin
    et al. 2019</xref>), which is pre-trained on a large corpus of
    general human text, meaning for tasks like NER it performs better
    compared with simpler models. Our NER model was then trained to
    identify all place names within this corpus. Coordinate information
    was attributed with all identified place names, using OS Open
    Names<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9">9</xref>, and ‘natural’ locations
    from the Gazetteer of British Place
    Names<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10">10</xref>. Given place names
    typically appear multiple times in gazetteers, a disambiguation
    method was required. We therefore disambiguated place names by
    finding their minimum distance to a collection of contextual
    locations. Contextual locations in this case referred to all
    gazetteer entries matching place names that appear in sentences with
    this target place name, within the same subreddit. This worked under
    the assumption that each unique place name in a single subreddit is
    likely to refer to the same location, and that locations mentioned
    in surrounding text are likely geographically close together
    (<xref alt="Kamalloo and Rafiei 2018" rid="ref-kamalloo2018" ref-type="bibr">Kamalloo
    and Rafiei 2018</xref>). When associating locations with coordinate
    information, we excluded any location that was larger than a city,
    for example countries or regions.</p>
    <p>Our final dataset therefore consisted of a collection of place
    names with their geographic coordinates, corpus location, and an
    anonymised user ID for the user of the comment the place name was
    taken from. In total, 213,764 unique users mentioned at least one
    place name in our corpus, 39,050 mentioned more than 10 place names,
    and 3,158 over 100. 1% of these contributed 32% of all place names,
    representing the top 2,137 users. As is common in user-generated
    content, our data are skewed in that proportionally few users
    mention a large proportion of our total place names. The large
    volume of unique users that contribute low volumes of comments do
    however mean that we likely still achieve a broad representation,
    particularly compared with past work that generated mental maps for
    a limited number of individuals
    (<xref alt="Goodchild and Li 2012" rid="ref-goodchild2012" ref-type="bibr">Goodchild
    and Li 2012</xref>). As our comments spanned a period of over 10
    years, we also examined the temporality of contributions made by
    users. The mean time between a user’s first and final comment is
    318.1 days, with a maximum of 4112 days. As such, the contributor
    distribution is highly skewed, as the majority of users (55%) only
    have commented a maximum of 1 day apart.</p>

    <title>Place associations through Co-occurrence</title>
    <p>‘Cognitive association strength’ is defined in our paper as the
    normalised proportion of co-occurrences between two locations in our
    corpus, where co-occurrences represent the total collection of
    locations mentioned by a single user. The following section first
    outlines the construction of distance decay measures using a gravity
    model that incorporates cognitive association strength alongside
    distance, then details how we generate a scaled measure of this
    cognitive association strength. The first measure enables us to
    quantify how distance impacts our association strength, determining
    whether there is an observable distance decay effect when
    considering locational co-occurrences in user comments. The second
    enables the direct strength of association between locations to be
    examined, without the incorporation of distance in the
    calculation.</p>

    normalises our values, given locations with higher populations are
    expected to be mentioned by a larger number of users. Values
    therefore range from 0 indicating no association, to 1, showing a
    complete overlap in user mentions.</p>
    <p>To present the results of our analysis we aggregate our user
    location mentions into H3
    hexagons<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12">12</xref>, a hierarchical
    spatial indexing system which partitions all locations across earth
    into a uniform hexagonal grid, available for different levels of
    aggregation. We select an H3 resolution of 5 which equates to an
    average hexagon area of 252 km<sup>2</sup> and an edge length of 9.8
    km. All associations between each location contained within a shared
    H3 hexagon are then combined, forming association measures between
    hexagons, rather that unique point locations. To name hexagons we
    select the most frequently occurring location.</p>
    <p>The use of fixed unit size hexagons for aggregating data in our
    analysis is beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, hexagons are
    geometries that enable us to obtain results that are statistically
    more robust especially when analysing distance decay between
    locations, because of the constant number of neighbours, with an
    equal distance separating them
    (<xref alt="Birch, Oom, and Beecham 2007" rid="ref-birch2007" ref-type="bibr">Birch,
    Oom, and Beecham 2007</xref>). Secondly, hexagon grids help to
    minimise misrepresentation in spatial visualisation
    (<xref alt="Langton and Solymosi 2021" rid="ref-langton2021" ref-type="bibr">Langton
    and Solymosi 2021</xref>), and allow us to capture inter-region
    heterogeneity. Finally, aggregation is essential given the data
    representations of locations within gazetteers; despite many
    locations having large footprints, they are all represented as a
    single coordinate pair
    (<xref alt="Goodchild and Hill 2008" rid="ref-goodchild2008" ref-type="bibr">Goodchild
    and Hill 2008</xref>). This problem means that despite users
    mentioning locations like parks within cities, without aggregation
    they are treated as two distinct points, with a geographic distance
    separating them. Alternatively OpenStreetMap can be used to provide
    more accurate place footprints, but at the cost of a very large data
    volume when considering the entirety of the UK
    (<xref alt="Haklay and Weber 2008" rid="ref-haklay2008" ref-type="bibr">Haklay

    <p>In total, 26.8% of all comments within the Reddit corpus
    contained at least one place name: 5,001,261 place names were
    identified, with 2,848,310 (57.0%) being attributable to a set of
    coordinates<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15">15</xref>. From these
    locations, 42,333 were found to be unique, of which 21,014 were only
    mentioned a single time, while London was the most frequently
    encountered location, at 283,521 mentions. The most ambiguous place
    name was found to be ‘High Street’, with 47 total unique coordinate
    locations. As expected, many of the most ambiguous place names were
    street names, including ‘Church Street’ (36 locations), ‘Bridge
    Street’ (34 locations), and ‘London Road’ (34 locations).</p>

    <p>In <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-noise">Figure 1</xref> we

    geoparsed. <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-noise">Figure 1</xref> (a)
    shows the geographic distribution of all 47 ‘High Street’ locations.
    The percentage values indicate the proportion of ‘High Street’
    mentions within a particular H3 polygon, compared to all other
    locations in this polygon. Aggregation here appears to mitigate the
    risk of noise in most cases, given most ‘High Street’ locations
    contribute lower than 1% towards polygon associations. A similar
    case is shown in
    <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-noise">Figure 1</xref> (b), where
    ‘City Centre’ mentions only account for 3.2% of the Manchester
    hexagon. <xref alt="Figure 1" rid="fig-noise">Figure 1</xref> (c)
    instead demonstrates a location that is impossible to correctly
    geoparse in our model, and despite there being 13 unique locations
    in the UK called ‘California’, this issue only appears prominent in
    one hexagon. This hexagon named ‘California’ does potentially
    generate noise in our analysis, given the high contribution of
    85.1%. However, as users that mention ‘California’ are spread across
    the country, it is less likely to largely impact our
    associations.</p>
    <p>Notably, despite both ‘High Street’ and ‘City Centre’ being
    shared with non-specific geographic concepts, the model is still
    able to distinguish between them depending on context. For example,
    ‘city centre’ appears 23,961 times in our corpus, but is only tagged
    by our NER model 3,008 times. While ‘high street’ appears 7,773
    times and is only tagged 768 times. These results suggest that the
    model is often able to correctly understand that identical phrases
    may or may not refer to place names, depending on their semantic
    context.</p>

    distance between two regions. Many of the top residuals concern
    associations shared with London and other major cities in the UK,
    with some associations between urban areas in Scotland. The most
    positive residual is the association between London and Edinburgh

    Edinburgh in third (3.81). As expected, these residuals reflect a
    strong association between regions over larger distances (mean 293

    effective. Notably, there is an incorrect association here between a
    natural feature named ‘London Bridge’ and London, which has appeared
    due to the lack of urban landmarks in our gazetteer. The bottom
    residuals are more sporadic, typically showing associations over
    shorter distances (mean 156 km), between lesser known locations that

    <p>We have demonstrated that not only does distance decay vary
    between rural and urban locations, but within these classes there is
    also apparent heterogeneity. In the following section, we therefore
    consider the ability to directly map the strength of cognitive
    associations with respect to a selection of both rural and urban
    regions in our study, to understand the variation in distance decay
    patterns.</p>

    different decay pattern, showing a sharp drop in associations

    coefficient, where association strength drops more quickly and is
    less persistent across England, only increasing with urban locations
    in Scotland, and slightly with London. While both are major cities

    <p>Edinburgh (c) is distinct compared with other cities, with a

    captures the sense of national identity associated with both Wales
    and Scotland, and conforms with results from the analysis of both

    intra-connectivity within regions, that becomes weaker when moving

  <title>Conclusions, Implications and Future Work</title>
  <p>In our work we present an alternative method for determining
  subconscious associations between locations, generating quantifiable
  measures of association strength solely using user-generated social
  media text. Unlike physical or online social interactions, our
  cognitive associations are intended as persistent measure of strength
  between locations across the UK, built from the naive, place-based
  geographic knowledge of individuals. Our geoparsing process means that
  no explicitly geographic information like geotags are required in our
  data source, allowing for the inclusion of fine-grained and informally
  defined locations, and associations may be examined between any two
  locations identified in our corpus.</p>
  <p>By utilising a distance-based gravity model, we demonstrate that
  our associations do broadly conform with established real-world
  geographic restrictions, through an observed distance-decay effect,
  but with notable deviations. Unlike past work that only considered
  co-occurring city names, we expand our analysis to incorporate place
  name mentions of any scale, which enables the exploration of both
  rural and suburban decay. We are therefore able to demonstrate that
  distance decay is greater in rural areas compared with urban areas,
  and that cities across the UK have varying patterns in distance decay.
  Associations between major cities like Manchester and London are
  demonstrably stronger than less prominent intermediate locations, an
  effect that challenges the notion of Euclidean distance in a mental
  understanding of geography

  a uniform concept

  <xref alt="Montello 1993" rid="ref-montello1993" ref-type="bibr">Montello
  1993</xref>). Alternative patterns are also demonstrated, particularly
  for locations in Scotland, where distance appears to have little
  impact on association strength, until locations across the border into
  England are reached. This observation appears to correlate with the
  concept of a ‘boundary effect’, that has been captured in both
  physical and online networks

  <xref alt="Yin et al. 2017" rid="ref-yin2017a" ref-type="bibr">Yin et
  al. 2017</xref>). This example is particularly interesting,
  replicating past research that generated mental maps from individuals
  through participatory mapping, which captured strong desirability
  towards areas within Scotland from residents, that did not persist
  across the border into England
  (<xref alt="Gould and White 1968" rid="ref-gould1968" ref-type="bibr">Gould
  and White 1968</xref>)</p>
  <p>The distinct patterns in distance decay that we observe demonstrate
  differences in associations between cities that capture real-world
  perceptions of these locations. For example, regions of low
  association across the UK may reflect the lack of desire to connect
  more broadly with the rest of the country
  (<xref alt="Roos Breines, Raghuram, and Gunter 2019" rid="ref-roosbreines2019" ref-type="bibr">Roos
  Breines, Raghuram, and Gunter 2019</xref>). This is particularly
  noticeable in Scotland, Wales, and the North East of England, regions
  where populations often exhibit a strong sense of independence from
  the UK, driven by a sense of regional or national pride
  (<xref alt="Haesly 2005" rid="ref-haesly2005" ref-type="bibr">Haesly

  <xref alt="Nayak 2016" rid="ref-nayak2016" ref-type="bibr">Nayak
  2016</xref>). Strong associations with London and Manchester are also
  indicative of their importance nationally, while cities like Newcastle
  are perceived as less important, resulting in lower associations.
  Imbalance in rural locations may also be driven by an increasing
  dependence on digital maps
  (<xref alt="Farman 2020" rid="ref-farman2020" ref-type="bibr">Farman
  2020</xref>); rural landmarks are far less common compared with cities
  with named streets and buildings
  (<xref alt="Laurier, Brown, and McGregor 2016" rid="ref-laurier2016" ref-type="bibr">Laurier,

  conceptualise rural environments
  (<xref alt="Smith et al. 2020" rid="ref-smith2020" ref-type="bibr">Smith
  et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
  <p>Finally, Reddit is unique compared with alternative social media
  sources; general activity is centred around discussing specific topics
  or themes within communities, relative to more general social networks
  such as Twitter or Facebook
  (<xref alt="Sylla et al. 2022" rid="ref-sylla2022" ref-type="bibr">Sylla

  <xref alt="Medvedev, Lambiotte, and Delvenne 2019" rid="ref-medvedev2019" ref-type="bibr">Medvedev,
  Lambiotte, and Delvenne 2019</xref>). Communities on Reddit therefore
  present the opportunity to generate collective, but geographically
  disaggregated representations of spatial knowledge. Locations
  identified from within these communities likely represent urban areas
  of interest which may be derived based on their frequency of mentions
  (<xref alt="Chen 2019" rid="ref-chen2019" ref-type="bibr">Chen
  2019</xref>), or semantic regions that reflect mental perceptions of
  places
  (<xref alt="Gao et al. 2017" rid="ref-gao2017a" ref-type="bibr">Gao et
  al. 2017</xref>). These unstructured comments also provide contextual
  lexicons relating to places names, meaning there is also the
  opportunity to explore associations between these communities through
  their associated typology

  <xref alt="Arthur and Williams 2019" rid="ref-arthur2019" ref-type="bibr">Arthur

  information
